discord.py==2.3.2
Flask==3.0.0

That's it! The keep_alive code is now integrated into the main bot file, so you don't need a separate `keep_alive.py` file.

## 🚀 Steps to Deploy:

1. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - Upload `bot.py` (the updated code)
   - Upload `requirements.txt`

2. **On Render:**
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `python bot.py`
   - Add environment variable: `TOKEN` = your discord bot token

3. **Deploy and Done!**

The bot will now stay alive on Render's free tier because it runs a Flask web server in the background. You should see these messages in the logs:
